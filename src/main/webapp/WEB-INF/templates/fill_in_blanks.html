            <p>The scientist has found several pieces of DNA to find out whether this gene is the right one,
            we'll need to throw our little piece of DNA against a whole database with DNA sequences. Before we do that though,
        let's make sure the scientist's DNA sequences all equal to each other. The scientist has told us that the pieces of DNA are all
        over a 1000 nucleotides long. Pfft, we don't want to type that out all the type. Let's create a variable, so we can store our
        DNA sequences.
            </p>
            <p>A variable serves as a container for our item. Variables come in many different types, but this will be a simple string of characters.
            You can create a variable using the '=' sign. For example x = "apples". This means x now stores the word, the string, apples.
            Now, you create a variable called 'string_1'</p>

            <p>Well done! Our variable string_1 now holds that long DNA sequence. Next up, we'll compare this variable to
            the sequences in our database. We are going to use something called a for-loop. It looks something like this:</p>
            <p>For every apple inside the apple basket:</p>
            <p class="p_1">    Clean the apple.</p>
            <p>What if some of the apples inside this basket are already clean? We wouldn't need to clean those, so we add
            an 'if' statement to have some control over what we are doing inside this for-loop.</p>
            <p class="p_1">For every apple inside the apple basket:
                if the apple is clean:
                    Don't clean the apple
                Else:
                    Clean the apple</p>
            <p>Our database is full of genes, we're going to loop through this small database and try to find our gene in it.
            A perfect use for our for-loop and an if statement as the only gene we really need is the one that matches with
            the sequence in string_1. So let's make a for-loop that goes through every gene in the database. The basics are there,
            you'll only need to add in what is missing.</p>

            <p>Look at that, we found our gene! Our last job will be to translate our gene to the proper amino acid chain.</p>
